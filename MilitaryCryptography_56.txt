57. Example of Polyalphabeﬁc Substitution

a. A simple example may be used to illustrate what is meant by true
polyalphabetic substitution. Suppose that two correspondents agree upon
a numerical key, for example, 74030274, each digit of which means
that the plain-text letter to which the digit applies as a key number is to
be replaced by the letter that stands a corresponding number of places to
the right of it in the normal alphabet. For example, if R is to be en-
ciphered by key number 7, it is to be replaced by Y. The numerical key is
written under the letters of the plain—text letter for letter, and is repeated
until the whole text is covered. Let the message be REENFORCE—
MEN TS BEING RU SIIED. The encipherment of a message is shown
in ﬁgure 15. For convenience in counting forward (to the right) to ﬁnd
cipher equivalents, a normal alphabet is given at the top of the ﬁgure.

Normal alphabet: AB CDEFGHI J KLMN OPQRSTUVWXYZ
Plain: REENFORCEMENTS BEING RUSHED

Key: 74030274740502 74740 302747
Cipher: YIEQFQYGLQEQTU IIPRG UUUOIK

The text is then transmitted in ﬁve-letter groups.
Cryptogram: YIEQF QYGLQ EQTUI IPRGU UUOIK

Figure 15.

b. To decipher such a cryptogram, the clerk writes the numerical key
over the cipher letters and then counts backward (to the left) in the
normal alphabet as many places as indicated by the key number standing
over each letter. Thus:

Normal alphabet: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

Key: 74030 27474 03027 47405 02747

Cipher: YIEQF QYGLQ EQTUI IPRGU UUOIK

Plain: REENF ORCEM ENTSB EINGR USHED

Message: REENFORCEMENTS BEING RUSHED

58. Systematizing the Work

The work of encipherment may be materially shortened by systematiz-
ing the procedure. Instead of having to write the key over and over again
in order to cover the text completely, the text may be written in sets of

letters corresponding in length to the length of
4 .
7 4 0 3 0 2 7 the key. Thus the text may be written underneath

R E E N F 0 R C . . .
