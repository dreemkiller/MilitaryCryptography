Each letter is represented by a combination of two digits; in preparing
the message for cryptographing, the two digits comprising the cipher
equivalent of a letter are written one below the other, thus:

Plain text: ONE PLANE REPORTED LOST
. 801...: 101 11001 01110011 1120

Cipher
202...: 833 97233 83988732 7817

By recombining the single digits in pairs, reading from horizontal
lines, and writing down the pairs in unchanged numerical form, one
obtains the following:

10 11 10 01 01 11 00 11 11 20
83 39 72 33 83 98 87 32 78 17

b. The foregoing cipher text can be transmitted in 5—ﬁgure groups.
or it can be reconverted into letters by one means or another, but
some difﬁculties are encountered in the latter case because every one
of 100 different pairs of digits has to be provided for, thus necessitating
a 2-letter substitution, which would make the cipher text twice as long
as the plain text.

c. In the methods to follow presently, these difﬁculties are avoided
by a simple modiﬁcation. This modiﬁcation consists in the employment
of true polyﬁa' cipher alphabets, that is, polypartite alphabets in which
the plain component is the normal sequence and the cipher component
consists of a sequence of equivalents composed of all the permutations
of 2, 3, 4, . . . symbols taken in deﬁnite groups. For example, a
biﬁa’ alphabet8 composed of permutations of ﬁve digits taken two at a
time can be constructed, yielding a set of 25 equivalents for a 25—letter
alphabet (I and J being usually considered as one letter). A triﬁd
alphabet of 27 equivalents can be constructed from all the permutations
of the digits 1, 2, 3, taken three at a time; an extra character must,
however, be added to represent the 27th element of the alphabet. It
is convenient to represent the parts of a biﬁd equivalent by the symbols
91., and 6%, the parts of a triﬁd equivalent, by the symbols 01c, 02c
and 03c.

5 Such an alphabet should be clearly differentiated from a biliteral alphabet. In the latter. two
and only two elements are employed, in groups of ﬁves, yielding 25 or 32 permutations. The
Biliteral Cipher of Sir Francis Bacon and the Baudot Alphabet of modern printing telegraph
systems are based upon alphabets that are typical examples of biliteral alphabets. The desig-
nation dt'arnpht'c alphabet will he applied to one in which the cipher equivalents are composed
of any number of symbols, n, taken simply in groups of two, these symbols not being permuted
in systematic fashion to produce a complete set of 2" equivalents.
