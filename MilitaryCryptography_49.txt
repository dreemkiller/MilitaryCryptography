positions of a few of them. Their chief disadvantage is that they must be
reduced to writing, since they cannot readily be remembered, nor can
they be reproduced at will from an easily remembered key word.

50. Number of Single Alphabets Available from a Basic 'Alphabel'

It is obvious that the cipher component of a cipher alphabet may be
shifted or slid against the plain component at 26 points of contact so as
to produce a series of different enciphering alphabets. For example, the
mixed sequences given under (b) of ﬁgure 11, when used as a cipher
component, yields the following two of a series of 26 cipher alphabets:

Enciphering Alphabets

(1) Plain: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Cipher : EBMZHFSLCQN IVOGUPDRTAKXYJ W

( 2) Plain : ABCDEFGHI J KLMN OPQRSTUVWXYZ
Cipher : WEBMZHFSLCQN IVO GUPDRTAKXY J

The message DAILY REPORT NOT RECEIVED YET would be
enciphered by the ﬁrst alphabet as:

Plain: DAILY REPOR TNOTR ECEIV EDYEII
Cipher: ZECIJ DHUGD TOGTD HMHCK HZJHT

and by the second alphabet as:

Plain: DAILY REPOR TNOTR ECEIV EDYET
Cipher: MWLNY PZGOP RVORP ZBZLA ZMYZR

Externally the two cryptograms seem different except in length. The two
enciphering alphabets present the same sequence in the cipher compo-
nent, but this entirely disappears in the corresponding deciphering
alphabets, which are as follows:

Deciphering Alphabets

l Cipher: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
( ) Plain: UBIRAFOELYVHCKNQJSGTPMZWXD

.2 Cipher: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
( ) Plain: VCJSBGPFMZWIDLORKTHUQNAXYE

It is possible to write the same message in 25 different external forms,
each using a different cipher alphabet of a series derivable from a
basic sequence. The basic sequence or alphabet in such a case is often
called a primary sequence or a primary alphabet; derived alphabets
are called secondary alphabets. In producing secondary alphabets the
basic sequence must be juxtaposed and slid against itself, or against
the normal sequence, or against another mixed sequence. In all cases
secondary alphabets form a series of alphabets that are interrelated and
