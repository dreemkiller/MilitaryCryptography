selected transposition methods, when repetitive in character, can produce
cryptograms of very great security.

130. Repetitive Monoalphabetic Substitution Systems

Suppose a message undergoes a primary encipherment by means of
a single-mixed, nonreciprocal alphabet, and the primary cipher text
undergoes a secondary encipherment by means of the same or a
diﬁ‘erent mixed alphabet. The resulting cryptogram is still mono-
alphabetic in character, and presents very little, if any, augmentation
in the degree of security (depending upon the type of alphabet em—
ployed). Here an entirely illusory increase in security is involved and
an ineffectual complexity is introduced; the process may indeed be
repeated indeﬁnitely without producing the desired result. This is because
the fundamental nature of monoalphabetic substitution has not been
taken into consideration in the attempts at superencipherment;
sCi—escg—M‘C; . . . , still remains monoalphabctic in character.

131. Repetitive Polyalphabetic Substitution Systems

a. If the primary encipherment is by means of the repeating—key
principle, with standard alphabets, and the secondary encipherment is
similar in character, with similar alphabets, and a key of similar length,
the ﬁnal cryptogram presents no increase in security at all. Thus, if the
key BCDE is used in the primary encipherment (Vigenére Method)
and the key FGHI is used in the secondary encipherment, the ﬁnal
result is the same as though the key GIKM had been used in a single
encipherment.

b. If mixed alphabets are used, and if those of the primary, and the
secondary encipherment belong to the same series of secondary alphabets
resulting from the sliding of two primary sequences against each
other, the results are similar in character to those described in a above.
They are identical with those that would be obtained by an equivalent
single encipherment by the appropriate secondary alphabets.

c. If the key for the secondary encipherment is of a different length
from that for the primary encipherment, the results are, however,
somewhat different, in that the period of the resultant cryptogram
becomes the least common multiple of the two key lengths. For example,
if the length of the key for the primary encipherment is 4, that for
the secondary 6, the result is the same as though a key of 12 elements
had been employed in a single encipherment. This can be demonstrated
as follows, using the keys 4—1—2—3 and 5-2—6—1—4—3:

41234123 4123 41234123 4123 4123..'.
