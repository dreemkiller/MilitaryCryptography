Figure 63.

(Z) 01,, and 02,, are in the same row; the letter immediately to the
right of 01,, forms 0‘.., the letter immediately to the right of 0”,,
forms 9%. “1th either 01,, or 0“,, is at the extreme right of the
row, the ﬁrst letter in the row becomes its 0c. Examples:
m, = Kﬁc; M6,. = K159; XE. = NEG; ﬁp = We.

(3) 01,, and 0", are in the same column; the letter immediately below
0‘, form 01..., the letter immediately below 0”,, forms 02“. When
either 01,. or 0', is at the bottom of the column, the top let_ter
in that column becomes_ its 0“. Examples: E = CBe;
W, = 71752:; W, = X1", ; 6—17,. = ﬁ..

(4) 0‘, and 02,, are identical; they are to be separated by inserting
a null, usually the letter X or Q. For example, the word
BATTLES would be enciphered thus:

BA T-X TL ES
DM RW CO KP
b. The l’layfair square is automatically reciprocal so far as encipher-
ments of type ( 1) above are concerned; but this is not true of encipher-
ments of type (2) or (3).

118. Rectangular Designs

a. It is not essential that matrices for digraphic substitution be in the
shape of perfect squares; rectangular designs will serve equally well,
with little or no modiﬁcation in procedure. Tn four-alphabet 'and two-
alphabet rectangles reciprocity can be produced by following the method
indicated in paragraph 115.

b. In ﬁgures 64 and 65 are shown two examples of such rectangles,
together with illustrations of cncipherments. Since the English alphabet
consists of 26 letters, a number which can only form an impracticable
rectangle 2 by 13, and since the addition of any symbols such as the
digits 1, 2, 3 . . . to augment the number of elements to 27, 28, 30, 32,
35, or 36 characters would result in producing cryptograms containing
intermixtures of letters and ﬁgures, the only practicable scheme is to
reduce the alphabet to 24 letters as shown in the ﬁgures, where I serves
also for J and U also for V,
