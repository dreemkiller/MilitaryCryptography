d. Biﬁd and triﬁd alphabets may be combined within a single sys-
tem with appropriate groupings, but such combinations may be con—
sidered as rather impracticable for military usage.

140. Fractionation Combined with Columnar Transposition

a. An excellent system of combined substitution-transposition that
has stood the test of practical, war-time usage is that now to be
described. Let a 36—character bipartite alphabet square be drawn up,
and a message enciphered, as follows:

N B 2 p Y N D BIA HAPPY LAND. Digits are inserted imme-
T 4 E 5 F 6 G diately after each letter from A to J, A being
E 7 J g K Q R followed by l, B, 2, etc.)

The C1 text is now inscribed in a rectangle of predetermined dimen-
sions. Transposition rectangle (columnar, based on key HAIL COLUM-
BIA HAPPY LAND) (see ﬁgure 70).

b. One of the important advantages of this type of cipher is that
it affords accuracy in transmission since the text is composed of a
