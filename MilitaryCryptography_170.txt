CHAPTER 11
CIPHER DEVICES AND CIPHER MACHINES

 

Section I. CIPHER DEVICES
141. General

The cipher systems previously described by no means exhaust the
category of complex systems, but it is impossible to describe them all.
Furthermore, each one presents innumerable possibilities for modiﬁcation
in minor respects and for combination with other methods. In the
paragraphs to follow, the principles upon which certain of the more
simple cipher devices have been based are described.

a. The device is a little more than four inches in diameter, and
consists of a dial with two hands, as shown in ﬁgure 71. The dial is
composed of two independent circles of letters. In the outer circle the
letters progress clockwise in normal alphabetic sequence, but there
is an extra character between the Z and the A, making a total of-
27 characters. Some of the spaces also have digits inscribed. in them,
for enciphering numbers. In the inner circle the letters are arranged
in mixed alphabetic sequence and are inscribed either on a surface
which permits of erasure, or on a. detachable cardboard circle which
can be removed and replaced by another circle bearing a different
sequence. In ﬁgure 71 this inner sequence is a systematically mixed
sequence derived from the keyword FRANCE, as follows:

1..Credit: for the invention of the device and system described in this paragraph belongs not
to Sir Charles Wheatstone, as has until recently been thought, but to an American, Decius
Wadsworth, who in 1817 constructed a device identical in principle with that described on
pp. 342—347 of The Scientiﬁc Papers of Sir Charles Wheatrtoue. Published by the Physical
Society of London in 1879. The Wheatstone device used a 27-elernent outer alphabet (26 letters
