b. Instead of using the cipher letters in sets, as shown, the last cipher
letter given by the use of the keyword may become the keyletter for
enciphering the plain-text letter; the cipher resultant of the latter then

becomes the keyletter for enciphering the following letter, and so on to
the end of the message. Thus: '

Key text: . TRUEJ LDQXT CZRPW OANIA JFAAP EWJDA . . .
Plain text: HEAVY INTER DICTI ONFIR EFALL INGAT . . .
Cryptogram:

MNUJL DQXTC ZRPWO ANIAJ FAAPE WJDAH .

c. It is obvious that an initial keyword is not necessary; a single pre-
arranged letter will do.

d. The plain text itself may serve as a key, after an initial group or
an initial letter. This is shown in the following example, wherein the text

of the message itself, after the prearranged initial keyword TRUE,
forms the key text:

Key text: TRUEH EAVYI NTERD ICTIO NFIRE FALLI . . .
Plain text: HEAVY INTER DICTI ONFIR EFALL INGAT . . .
Cryptogram :

MNUJJ WNCUR KLCYV UPOAX JAIGT XNFLP .

e. Although reversed standard alphabets have been used in all the
foregoing examples, it is obvious that various types of alphabets may
be employed, as prearranged.

f. The following method, although it may at ﬁrst appear to be quite
different, is in reality identical with those just described. A mixed
sequence is prepared and its elements numbered in sequence. Let the
mixed sequence be derived from the keyword PERMUTABLY:

63759812410

Let the message be the same as before, and let the ﬁrst letter be its own
cipher equivalent. Each cipher letter from that point on is produced
in turn by ﬁnding the sum of the numerical equivalents of the preceding
cipher letter and the plain—text letter to be enciphered. When this total

exceeds 26, the latter amount is deducted and the letter equivalent of the
remainder is taken for the cipher letter. Thus:

145
