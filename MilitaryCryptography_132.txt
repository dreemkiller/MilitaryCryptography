called logotypes or ligatures, so in cryptography, when combinationsof
two or more letters are to be treated as a unit in a cryptographic process,
they may also be called ligatures and can be conveniently indicated as
being so by placing a bar across the top of the combination. Thus, C—Op
represents the digraph C0 of the plain text. It will also be convenient to
use the Greek letter 0 to represent a letter of the alphabet, without indi—
cating its identity. Thus, instead of the circumlocution “any letter of the
plain text”, the symbol 0,, will be used; and for the expression “any
letter of the cipher text”, the symbol 9,, will be used. The symbol 0—0,, then
means “any plain-text digraph”; the symbol We “any cipher—text dia-
graph.” To refer speciﬁcally to the lst, 2d, 3d . . . member of a ligature,
the exponent l, 2, 3 . . . will be used. Thus, 02,, of REMD is the letter E;
03, MW, is 2.

113. Polygraphic Substitution by Means of Tables

. a. The most simple method of effecting polygraphic substitution
Involves the use of tables similar to that shown in table I. This table
merely presents equivalents for digraphs and is to be employed upon
the coordinate system, 01,, of 71—0—21. being sought in the column at the left
or ﬁght, 92,, in the row at the top or bottom. The cipher pair, We, is
