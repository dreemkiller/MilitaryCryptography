Figure 23.

b. Figure 23 illustrates a case in which a mixed alphabet is sliding
against itself. The usual method of employing such a table is exactly
the same as that explained before. The only difference is that both the
plain—text letters and the key letters must be looked for in mixed
sequences. Example, using ﬁgure 23: Up (R1,) = Vc.

c. It has been indicated that the basis of reference in most crypto—
graphic operations involving key words is the letter A”. In employing
sliding alphabets it is usual to set the key letter as located in the cipher
component opposite the letter A as located in the plain component. But,
as shown in paragraphs 42!; and 60c, the key letter as located in the
cipher component is usually set opposite the initial letter of the plain
component. In all examples preceding that in ﬁgure 23, the key letter has
been A. In ﬁgure 23, since the plain component is also a mixed sequence
and its initial letter is Q, the sliding alphabets are set against each other
so that the given key letter in the cipher component is opposite Q in the
plain component. Thus, to duplicate the results given by the use of ﬁgure
23 in ﬁnding the value of Up (R1,), it is necessary to set the sliding strips
in the following relatiVe positions:
