d. A reciprocal alphabet is an inverse alphabet, since it may serve i
either as an enciphering or deciphering alphabet.

44. Procedure in Enciphermenf and Decipherment

a. When a message is enciphered monoalphabetically, that is, by
means of a single cipher alphabet, letters of the text are replaced by the
equivalents in the cipher alphabet selected by prearrangement. Example:

Message: THREE MACHINE GUNS CAPTURED.
Enciphering Alphabet: Reversed Standard, AI) = D.,.
Plain : ABCDEFGHI J KLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Cipher : DCBA ZYXWVUT SRQPO‘NMLKJIHGFE
Letter-for-letter encipherment:
THREE MACHINE GUNS CAPTURED
KWMZZ RDBWVQZ XJQL BDOKJMZA

The cipher text is then grouped in ﬁves and the indicator letter D“
inserted as the initial letter of the ﬁrst group (or any other prearranged

group) .

Cryptogram:
DKWMZ ZRDBW VQZXJ QLBD-O KJMZA

Figure 10.

b. The procedure in decipherment is merely the reverse of that in
encipherment. The initial letter of the message, D, indicates A, = Dc in
the cipher alphabet. The deciphering alphabet is therefore as follows:

Cipher : AB CDEFGHI J KLMN OPQRSTUVWXY Z
Plain : DCBA ZYXWVUT SRQPONMLKJ IHGFE

The message deciphers thus:
Cipher: (D) KWMZ ZRDBW VQZXJ QLBDO KJMZA
Plain: THRE EMACH INEGU NSGAP TURED E

The deciphering clerk rewrites the text in word lengths:
THREE MACHINE GUNS CAPTURED

c. When a mixed alphabet is used, the enciphering and deciphering
processes are the same as those described under a and b above. For
speed in cryptographing, the cipher alphabet is prepared in the form of
an enciphering alphabet, and for speed in decryptographing, in the form
of a deciphering alphabet.

'If this or any such similar convention has been agreed upon by the correspondents.
