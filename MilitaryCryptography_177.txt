b. Until a few years ago, code methods were predominant in military
cryptography within the United States Ariny but the reverse is now the
case. This important change has been the result of advances made within
comparatively recent years in the design and construction of crypto-
graphic systems and apparatus. It may be useful to compare code

methods

in general with methods based upon cipher devices and cipher

machines in general to note the advantages and disadvantages of each

category

of methods.

When designed for keyboard operation and equipped with a
standard typewriter keyboard, cipher machines afford much
more speed in encipherment and decipherment than do any
“hand—operated” cryptographic methods, including codes and
certain types of cipher devices. Comparative speed tests gave
the following data recently:

Number of group: or words per minute

1 4.04 (4-letter or 4—ﬁgure groups) .......................... 6.00
2 1.94 (4—letter or 4—ﬁgure groups) .......................... 2.26
3 1.75 (5-letter groups) ..................................... 1.78

'Method l—A 2—part code of 6,000 groups unenciphered.

Method Z—The same code enciphered by a secure systun.

Method S—The obsolete U. S. Army Cipher Device, Type M—94.

Method 4—A small electrical cryptographic machine giving lamp indications but not provided
with a typewriter keyboard.

Method S—The Converter, M—209.

Method G—An electrical cryptographic machine producing a printed record and provided with

a keyboard.

When properly designed, cipher machines and certain types of
"hand-operated” cryptographs aﬁord greater guarantees of
cryptographic security than do code methods or hand—operated
“pencil and paper” cipher systems, because machines can ac-
curately, speedily, and tirelessly perform far more complex
cryptographic operations than can possibly be performed even
by the most skillful cryptographers working with code books
and cipher tables, or with hand-operated cipher systems.

Though the initial cost of a cipher machine may compare un-
favorably with the initial cost of a code book, the over-all cost
of maintaining cryptographic security by means of cipher ma-
chines is probably less than that in the case of code systems.
Good machines designed by technically qualiﬁed experts afford
