102. Increasing the Security of Revolving Grilles

a. The total number of letters which a grille will exactly encipher is
termed its capacity. If the number of letters of a message is always equal
to the total capacity of the grille, this information is of great aid in solu-
tion by the enemy. For example, a message of 64 letters indicates a grille
8 by 8 with 16 apertures; one of 144 letters, a grille 12 by 12 with 36
apertures, and so on. There are, however, methods of employing a
grille so that it will serve to encipher messages the lengths of which are
greater or less than the capacity of the grille.

b. When the total number of letters is less than the capacity of the
grille, no modiﬁcation in method of use is necessary. Encipherment of
such a message comes to a close when the last plain-text letter has been
inscribed. In decryptographing such a message, the recipient must strike
out, on the grid upon which he is to inscribe the cipher text, a number of
cells corresponding to the difference between the number of letters of
the text as received and the total capacity of the grille. The location of
the cells to be thus eliminated must be prearranged, and it is best usually
to strike them off from the ﬁnal positions of the grid.

c. When the total number of letters is equal to or greater than the
capacity of the grille, a grid of greater capacity than that of the grille
can be prepared, on which the grille may be positioned several times,
thus forming a large or composite grid composed by the juxtaposition
of the several small grids. If there are a few cells in excess of the actual
number required, these may be struck off from the large grid at pre-
arranged points, for example, from the last column and row, as shown
in b of ﬁgure 48. The grille is then placed in its ﬁrst position in turn on
each of the component grids, then in its second position, and so on. An
example will serve to illustrate. A message of ﬁfty-two letters is to be
