b. By a slight change in procedure it is possible to encipher a mes—
sage and produce a text which, for the sake of accuracy in special
cases, is double the original length, but which is self—checking. Sup—
pose that instead of applying a single numerical key to the base of the
triangle, a double—length key is applied to the legs, as shown in
ﬁgure 27. Here the key is TRIANGLES, extended to double length
by simple repetition, as follows:

1—2-3-4-—5-6-7-8—9-10-11-12-13-14-15-16-17-18

Keyword: TRIANGLESTRIANGLES

Numerical key: 17-13-7-1-11-5-9-3-15-18-14—8—2-12—6-10—4-16
This key is applied to the legs of the triangle beginning at the lower
left-hand corner. The transcription then follows key—number order,
which results in doubling the length of the message but the repeated
letters are scattered throughout the whole message. In decryptographing
such a message the clerk merely omits the second occurrence of a letter
if it agrees (in identity) with its ﬁrst appearance in the text.

6. Many variations in inscription and transcription can be employed
in the case of triangles as well as trapezoids. Some of the variations in
the case of triangles are shown in ﬁgure 28.

88. Diagonal Methods

a. A method involving diagonal transposition which is reported to
have been employed by the French Army in World War I is now to
be described. A numerical key is derived from a fairly long word or
phrase, and a rectangle is constructed, as in ﬁgure 29. The text is
inscribed in this rectangle in normal fashion, nulls being employed, if
necessary, to complete the last line of the rectangle.
