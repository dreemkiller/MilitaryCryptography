Figure 25.

thetriangleis the sum ofn + (n — 1) + (n — 2 + (n —— 3) +...
+ 1. For a triangle based upon a side of 9 cells, the sum is 9 + 8 + 7
+ 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 +1: 45. The letters may then be tran-
scribed to form the cryptogram by following another route, or by follow-
ing a derived numerical key applied to the base of the triangle. A simple
method of deriving a key of Zn — 1 elements from a key of n elements
or letters is exempliﬁed herewith. Let the key be DIAGONALS, a word
of nine letters. Extend this key to Zn — 1 places by repetition, and then
assign numerical values as usual:

I! = 9; 2 n —- 1 = 17
O N A L S D I A G O N A L
5-13-2-11-17——6-10—3—8-16-l4——4-12

This numerical key is the one that has been employed in enciphering
the message in Figure 26.
