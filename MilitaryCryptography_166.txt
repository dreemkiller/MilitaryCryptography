138. Fractionating Systems as Forms of Combined Substitution
and Transposition

In studying the various types of substitution discussed in chapter 9,
section II, it was not apparent, and no hint was given, that these
systems combine both substitution and transposition methods into a
single method. But the analysis presented in paragraph 137 shows
clearly that there is a kind of transposition involved in digraphiq
methods involving the use of matrices.

139. Fractionation and Recombination within Regular or Variable
Groupings of Fractional Elements

0. This method is an extension or modiﬁcation of that illustrated
in paragraph 1362. Let the text be written out in groups of 3, 4, 5,
. . . letters, as prearranged between the correspondents. Suppose group-
ings of ﬁve letters are agreed upon; a biﬁd alphabet (that in par. 136e)
is used for substitution; thus:
