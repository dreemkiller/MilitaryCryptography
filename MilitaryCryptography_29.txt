24. Special Cases of Route Transposition

a. The oldest and simplest transposition method known, that called re-
versed writing, is a special case of one of the routes shown in ﬁgure 1.
Here the text is written in the opposite direction from the normal; for
example, BRIDGE DESTROYED is written EGDIRB DEYORTSED.
The variability of the scheme, that is, the speciﬁc key, consists of the fact
that the reversal may be applied to groups of ﬁxed length, to whole
words, to sentences, or to the whole text. The security of simple reversed
writing may be somewhat increased by disguising the original word
lengths, by which is meant a destruction of the normal, or natural word
limits by combining a part of one word with a part of the next to form
either false words or groups of regular length.

b. Some examples of reversed writing follow. Let the message be:
BRIDGE DESTROYED AT ELEVEN PM.

( l) Reversing only the words and retaining original word lengths:
Cipher: EGDIRB DEYORTSED TA NEVELE MP
(2) Reversing only the words and regrouping into false word
lengths:
Cipher: EG DIRB DEYOR'I‘ SEDTA NEVE LEMI>
(3): Reversing the whole text and regrouping into ﬁves:
Cipher: MPNEV ELETA DEYOR TSEDE GDIRB
(4) Reversing the whole text, regrouping into ﬁves, and inserting
a null in every ﬁfth position:
Cipher: MPNER VELEO TADEB YORTH SEDEA GDIRB

c. A second very simple type of transposition, that known as vertical

writing, is a special case of another of the routes shown in ﬁgure 1.

The message BRIDGE DESTROYED is written in two vertical BS
columns, and the cipher text is taken from the horizontal pairs RT

thus formed. The message becomes: IR
DO
BSRTI RDOGY EEDDE GY
EE
DD
E
‘ Figure 3.

When the plain text is inscribed in pairs of letters in vertical BR
writing and then the cipher text is taken by transcribing the ID
columns, a_ slightly different result is obtained. Using the plain GE

text message BRIDGE DESTROYED, the cipher becomes: DE
ST
BIGDS RYDRD EETOE R0
YE
D
