b. The two hands are pivoted concentrically, as are the hour and
minute hands of a clock. Now, in a clock, the minute hand makes a
complete revolution, while the hour hand makes only 1/12 of a com-
plete revolution; the action in the case of this device, however, is
somewhat different. The short hand is free 'to move independently
of the long one, although the motion of the latter affects the former.
Since the outer circle has 27 spaces and the inner one only 26, by a
simple mechanical contrivance each complete revolution of the long
hand causes the short hand to make 1%, revolutions, thus causing
the short hand to point one place in advance of where it pointed at
the end of the preceding revolution of the long hand. For example,
when the long hand is over B of the outer circle and the short hand
points to R of the inner circle, if the long hand is pushed clockwise
around the dial, making a complete revolution, the short hand will also
make a complete revolution clockwise plus one space, thus pointing
to D.

c. To encipher a message, the long hand and the short hand are
set to prearranged initial positions. It is usual to agree that the
plain-text letters will be sought in the outer circle of letters, their
cipher equivalents in the .inner circle; and that the long hand is
invariably to be moved in the same direction, usually clockwise.

Suppose the message to be enciphered is SEND AMMUNITION
FORWARD. The long hand is moved clockwise until it is directly

 

and a word-separator), and a 26-element inner alphabet; the Wadsworth device used a sit-element
outer alphabet (26 letters and the digits 2â€”8, inclusive), and a 26-dement inner alphabet.
Also, whereas in the Wheatstone device only the cipher component could be varied, in the
Wadsworth device both components could be varied according to identical or non-identical
mixed sequences.
