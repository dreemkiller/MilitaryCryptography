f. From the foregoing examples, it is obvious that many other ﬁgures
may be used for effective transpositions of this kind, such as stars
of varying numbers of points, polygons of various symmetrical shapes,
etc. It is merely necessary to agree upon the ﬁgures, the number of
ﬁgures per line, the starting points of the inscription and transcription
processes.

9. The method lends itself readily to combination with simple
monoalphabetic substitution, yielding cryptograms of a rather high
degree of security.

Section II. POLYPHASE TR'A-NSPOSITION SYSTEMS

92. Polyphase Transposition Methods in General

a. In paragraph 33, brief mention was made of transposition systems
in which two or more processes of rearrangement are involved. It was
stated that only a very limited number of such transposition methods
are practicable for military use, but that the degree of security afforded
by them is considerably greater than that afforded by certain much
more complicated substitution methods. The methods referred to are
those which involve two or more successive transpositions, and merely
for purposes of brevity in reference they will here be called polyphase
transposition methods to distinguish them from the single monophase
methods thus far described.

b. It is obvious that a polyphase transposition method may involve
2, 3, . . . successive transpositions of the letters of the plain text.
To describe these methods in general terms, one may indicate that
the letters resulting from a ﬁrst transposition, designated as the T—l
