laborious to count 573 groups forward, for example. In cases such as
these additives limited to numbers from 1 to 20 or 30 are common.

d. (1) Instead of adding a ﬁxed number in encipherment, the latter
may be subtracted, in' which case, in dccipherment, the ﬁxed
number must be added to the encicode groups as received. Such
a group may be termed a subtractive group, or subtractor, be-
cause subtraction is the process used in encipherment; in deci-
pherment the group becomes, of course, an additive.

(2) Addition and subtraction of a ﬁxed numerical group may be
alternated within the same message, according to some simple
subsidiary key; for example, a series of additive groups cor-
responding to the keyword BAD might, by prearrangement,
consist of the numbers 200, 100, 400. These might be used in
repetitive manner. Or the correspondents might agree to use
these key numbers alternatively in additive and subtractive
manner, such as +200, —100, +400, —200, +100, —400,
+200, —100, etc.

e. Addition without “carrying,” or noncarrying addition, is just as
simple as normal addition, that is, addition with “carrying"; and sub-
traction without “borrowing,” or nonborrowing subtraction, is just as
simple as normal subtraction, that is, subtraction with “borrowing.” It is
merely necessary that the correspondents agree in advance on this point
and apply the process consistently throughout a message. In practice,
however, it is more common to perform these processes without “carry-
ing” or “borrowing,” so that the operations can be performed from left
to right as in normal writing. Following is an example which will make
the matter clear.

Example A

(a) Example of ”noncarrying" addition in encipherment;

 

 

(1) Placode .......................... 5517 3082 9015 6710 9541

(2) Fixed group for addition ......... - 5678 5678 5678 5678 5678

(3) Encicode ......................... 0185 8650 468:5 T388 4119
(b) In dccipherment, "nanborro'wing” subtraction is applied:

(1) Encicode ......................... 0185 8650 4685 1388 4119

(2) Fixed group for subtraction ....... 5678 5678 5678 5678 5678

(3) Placode .......................... 5517 ﬁsosz 901? 6710 9541

(c) Note that in the decipherment process the enricode serves as the minuend, the
additive used in the encipherment serves as the subtrahend, and the placode
is the remainder.

f. In the foregoing example the additive remains the same through-
out the superencipherment but it is obvious that this is only the simplest
sort of an arrangement. A series of different additives may readily be
employed, as will be explained later.
