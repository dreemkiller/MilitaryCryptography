(8) As regards administrative communications, cipher cannot com—

pete with code from the point of view of condensation or
abbreviation. A cipher message is always at least as long as the
original plain-text message, whereas a code message prepared
by means of a large code Specially compiled to give a high
degree of condensation is usually much shorter than the equiv-
alent original plain—text message. This arises, of course, from
the fact that in well-constructed code books single groups of
4 or 5 characters may repreSent long phrases or even whole
sentences.

(9) As a rule, cipher devices or machines cannot readily be oper-

ated under all sorts of weather conditions. In very damp or in
rainy climates, machinery failures are quite common, and it is
difﬁcult to keep delicate machines in regular service. Moreover,
in hot, humid climates no machines can long survive the dis-
astrous corrosive effects of moisture, vegetable growths, etc.,
whereas printed matter is hardly affected by these elements.
Finally, under ﬁeld conditions, while a code book can be
manipulated outdoors in all sorts of weather, in rain, sleet, or
snow, in high altitudes where the temperature is very low, or
in the tropics where it is very hot and humid, a cipher machine,
especially if electrical, often cannot be operated with success
for more than a few minutes or, at most, a few hours.
