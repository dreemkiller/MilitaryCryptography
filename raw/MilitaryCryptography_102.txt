The letters of the plain text, taken in sets of ﬁves, are distributed
within the sections of the diagram in accordance with the permuta-
tions indicated above the sections and also at the left. Thus, the ﬁrst
ﬁve letters of the text, supposing them to be the initial letters of. the
word RECOMMENDATIONS, are inserted in the following positions:

Permutation

E C R M 0

 

The next ﬁve letters are inscribed in the second line of the diagram
in the sections indicated by the permutation above and at the- left of
the line. Thus:

 

 

 

 

Permutation
' 2 3 1 5 4
2 3 1 5 4 E C . R M O
3 2 5 1 4
l 4
5 2 5. N E A M D

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This process is continued for each line and for as many lines as there
are permutations indicated at the left. In the foregoing case, after
twenty letters have been inserted, one inserts a second set of ﬁve
letters again on the ﬁrst line, placing the letters of this second set
immediately to the right of those of the ﬁrst set, respectively in key-
number order. The succeeding lines are treated in similar fashion
until the whole message has been enciphered. The following example
will illustrate the process:
