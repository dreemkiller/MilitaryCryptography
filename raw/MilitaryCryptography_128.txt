c. In the foregoing case, the route is a succession of the moves made
by the king in the game of chess; it forms the so-called “king’s tour”,
in which the playing piece makes a complete or reentrant journey cover—
ing all cells of the chessboard, each cell being traversed only once. A
route c0mposed of a succession of moves made by the knight, or the so-
called “knight’s tour”, is also possible, but in order to be practical a grid
with the cells numbered in succession would have to be prepared for the
correspondents, since millions of different reentrant knight’s tours can
be constructed‘ on a chessboard of the usual 64 cells.

108. Transposition of Groups of Letters, Syllables. and Words

There is nothing in the previously described methods which precludes
the possibility of their application to pairs of letters, sets of three or
more letters, or even syllables and whole words. Nor, of course, is their
use limited to operations with plain text they may be applied as second—
ary steps after a substitutive process has been completed (see sec. I, ch.

10).

109. Disguised Transposition Methods

a. The system often encountered in romances and mystery stories,
wherein the message to be conveyed is inserted in a series of nonsig—
niﬁcant words constructed with the purpose of avoiding or evading sus-
picion, is a species of this form of “open” cryptogram involving trans—
position. The “open” or enveloping, apparently innocent text may be
designated as the exle-mal text; the secret or cryptographic text may be.
designated as the internal text. A complicated example of external or
open and internal or secret text is that shown in paragraph 98.
