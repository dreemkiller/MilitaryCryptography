the ﬁgures may be run together in groups of ﬁve. The cipher group
10080, on deCIPheﬂﬂg, would be split up into 10-08—0.

c. In this case, within each set of 25 the numbers progress serially,
each set being treated as a ring or circle. It is of course possible to mix
the sequence to destroy this serial progression, thus giving four mixed
alphabets which can be used at random.

d. Another variation is to assign each letter a set of numbers in ac-
cordance with its relative frequency in ordinary English, so that each of
the most frequently used letters such as E, T, R, I, and N will have
perhaps seven or eight different equivalents, whereas letters of low fre—
quency such as J, K, Q, X, and Z will each have but one equivalent.

54. Use of Reciangles to Provide Variant Values

0. Instead of drawing up alphabets as in ﬁgure 14, it is possible to use
the diagram shown in ﬁgure 12, but with several variant digits as row
indicators instead of a single digit for each row. For example, the row
indicators may be of the following arrangements:

14—7 1—2—3 1—2—3 5—4—3
2—5—8 4--5-6 8—9—4 6—9—2
3—4—9 7—8—9 7—6—5 7—8—1, etc.

Thus, if the. ﬁrst arrangement is used, A, would have the equivalents ll,
61, 71; B,,, 12, 62, 72; etc. The word RUN might be represented by
any one of 27 different combinations, such as 28—31—24, 28—91—54, etc.

b. A variation of the foregoing system is that in which, by use of a
diagram of the type shown in ﬁgure 13, a number of different letters are
applied to each row and column, or Z-ﬁgure numbers may be used for
this purpose. In this case a series of as many as 50 pairs of digits may be
used as row indicators, and another series of 50 pairs as the column
indicators.

c. The use of variants lends itself to application in a pseudo-code sys—
tem such as described in paragraph Sle. It presents many possibilities for
