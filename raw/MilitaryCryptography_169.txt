limited number of letters. In fact, if the horizontal and vertical
coordinates of the cipher square are the same letters, then the cryp-
tographic text is composed of permutations of but six different letters,
thus aiding very materially in correct reception. Indeed, it is even
possible to reconstruct completely a message that has been so badly
garbled that only half of it is present. This cipher system was used
with considerable success by the Germany Army in 1917—18, and was
known to the Allies as the ADFGVX Cipher, because these were
the letters used as horizontal and vertical coordinates of the cipher
square, and consequently the cipher text consisted solely of these
six letters.

c. The cipher text of the foregoing message is, of course, twice as
long as the plain text, but it can be reduced to exactly the original
plain-text length by combining the distributed or transposed 01c and
02,, elements in pairs, referring to the original (or a different) poly-
partite square, and recomposing the pairs into letters. In this case,
the horizontal and vertical coordinates must be identical in order to
permit of ﬁnding equivalents for all possible pairs.
