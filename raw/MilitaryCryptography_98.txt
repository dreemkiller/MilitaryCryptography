b. The correspondents agree beforehand upon several diagonals which
run from left to right, and from right to left and which intersect,
thus cutting up the design quite thoroughly. In ﬁgure 29 let these selected
diagonals be those indicated by the numbers from 1 to 6, inclusive,
the odd ones indicating diagonals running from left to right. In the
transcription, the letters along the indicated diagonals are ﬁrst set down
in groups of ﬁve, proceeding in key—number order. Correspondents must
also agree beforehand as to whether a letter which lies at the intersection
of two diagonals will be taken both times it is encountered or taken
only once and, if so, whether on its ﬁrst or second appearance. After
all these letters have been written down, one then proceeds with the
remaining letters in the usual columnar manner, omitting the letters
which have already been taken. The cryptographing process will become
clear upon the study of the example in ﬁgure 29.

89. Interrupted Keyword Transposition

a. This method of transposition is a development of a more simple
method wherein the transposition follows a numerical key. The latter
must ﬁrst be described. A keyword or keyphrase of fair length is selected
and a numerical key derived from it. Let this key be the phrase UNI-
FORMITY OF METHOD.

Keyphrase: UNIFORMITYOFME TH OD
Numerical key: 17-10-6-3-11-14-8-7-15-18-12-4-9-2-16-5-13-1
The plain text is then written out in horizontal lines corresponding
to the length of the key; then transposition is effected within each row,
according to the sequence of numbers applicable, as shown in ﬁgure 30.
