X, will be inserted in the plain text to show when the interruption takes
place. The plain text is enciphered by natural word lengths.

Key: U N U N P U
Plain text: OUR FRONTX LINES ARE NOWX REPORTED

d. It is also possible to interrupt the key regularly, cutting it up into
equal length sections as, for example, with the keyword EXTINGUISH-
ER: EXT/XTI/TIN/ING/NGU/GUI/UIS/ISH/SHE/HER. Each
set of three keyletters may serve to encipher a set of three plain-text
letters. But it is possible to make each set of three key-letters apply to
more than three plain—text letters, or to irregular groupings of plain-
text letters. For example, suppose a numerical key be derived from the
keyword:

E X T I N G U I S H E R
1—12-10—5—7—3-11—6—9—4—2—8

Let this numerical sequence determine how many letters will be enci-
phered by each grouping of the key. The example below will illustrate
(reversed standard alphabets are used) :

Numbers: 1 12 10 5
Key: E XTIXTIXTIXTI TINTINTINT INGIN
Plain text: 0 OLLECTALLSTR AGGLERSSTO PSEND
Cipher: C J IXTRPXIXFAR TCHIEWBQUF TVCVK
Numbers: 7 3 11

Key: NGUNGUN GUI UISUISU

Plain text: THEMFOR WAR DATO'NCE

Cipher: UZQBBGW KUR RIZGVQQ

Cryptogram: CJIXT RPXIX FARTC HIEWB QUFTV
CVKUZ QBBGW KURRI ZGVQQ

e. Another simple method of prearranging the interruption of a key—
word or of plain text is to employ the sequence of numbers given by
reducing an incommensurate fraction to decimals. For example, the
fraction 1/, yields the sequence 142857142857 . . . This fraction may
be represented by the indicator letter H given as the initial letter of
the cryptogram.

127. Cipher Devices in Which Periodicity Is 'Avoided

There are certain cipher devices which operate in such a manner
that periodicity is avoided or suppressed. Some of them are discussed
in section I, chapter 11. Among them one of the most interesting is
that invented by Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1867. As a rule, hOWever,
Cipher devices, by their very nature, can hardly avoid being cyclic in
Operation, thus causing periodicity to be exhibited in the cryptograms.
