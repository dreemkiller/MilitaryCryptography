The message RAIDERS HAVE GONE is enciphered thus:

Plain: RAIDERSHAVEGO'N'E
Cipher: THWWHT WT WE TH TI HI WWEWWEHH IT IIWE

The cryptogram is then transmitted in groups of ﬁve letters:
Cryptogram: THWWH TWTWE THTIH IWWEW WEHHI THWE

(I. In these two systems just described,

(I) The letters of the alphabet within the square or rectangle may
be ﬁxed in a mixed sequence, either systematically or random-
mixed sequences being possible.

(2) The column and row indicators may be the same, or different;
when letters are used they may form a key word or they may
not; the key words, if formed, may be identical or nonidentical.

e. When letters are used as column and row indicators, they may be
selected so as to result in producing cipher text that resembles “made-up
words,” that is, words composed of regular alternations of vowels and
consonants. For example, if in ﬁgure 13 the row indicators consisted of
the vowels A E I O U in this sequence from the top down, and the
column indicators consisted of the consonants B C D F G in this
sequence from left to right, the word RAIDS would be enciphered as
OCABE FAFOD, which very closely resembles code of the type for-
merly called artiﬁcial code language. Such a system may be called a
false, or pseudo-code system.’l

'Prior to 1934, International Telegraph Regulations required code words of ﬁve letters to
contain It least one vowel and code words of ten letters to contain at least three vowels. The
Madrid Conference held in 1932 amended these regulations to permit the use of code groups
containing any combination of letters. These unrestricted eude groups were authorized for use
after I Tannery 10.14.
