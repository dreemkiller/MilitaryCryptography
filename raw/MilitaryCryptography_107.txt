In producing the foregoing cryptogram only the columns were trans—
posed. Suppose that by prearrangement, using the keyword BREAK
(derived numerical key = 2—5—3—1—4), the horizontal lines of the fore—
going enciphering rectangle were also to be transposed. For example,
let the horizontal lines of the rectangle D—l be transposed immediately
before taking the letters out of the columns of the design (in key-number

c. The foregoing, however, is not a case of true polyphase or- so-
called double transposition. The same ﬁnal result may be accomplished
in a way which will at ﬁrst glance appear quite different but is in.
reality one that accomplishes the same two operations by combining
them in one operation. Let the message be inscribed as before, but this
time with both numerical keys applied to the top and side of the
rectangle. Then let another rectangle of the same dimensions, but with
numbers in straight sequence instead of key—number sequence, be set
alongside it. Thus: ' '

Each letter D—l is now transferred to that cell in D—2 which is indicated
by the row and column indicators of the letter in D—l. For example,
the ﬁrst letter, D, of D—l, has the indicators 2—7 and it is placed in
