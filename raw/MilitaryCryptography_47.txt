alphabet key is A, = In. Two or more correspondents using the pre-
arranged key, WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH COMPANY,
would obtain the same disarranged sequence; when this sequence is to
form the cipher component of a cipher alphabet, the prearranged key
letter A1, = Jo would result in giving each correspondent exactly the
same cipher alphabet. The key words or phrases need not consist of any
deﬁnite number of letters, but it is advisable to use for keys such words
or phrases as will most thoroughly disarrange the normal sequence. (See,
in this connection, par. 26.) A key-word mixed alphabet will manifest
the key word or parts of it only when the alphabet is in the form of
an enciphering alphabet. Note that alphabet (b) of ﬁgure 9 no longer
gives any external evidence of having been derived from the phrase
WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH COMPANY.

47. Transposition-mixed Alphabets

a. It is possible to disarrange the sequence even more thoroughly by
applying a simple method of transposition to the key—word sequence
as if it were a message. An example is illustrated in ﬁgure 11.

Key word:

TELPHONY

(a) Simple columnar transposition:
TELPHONY
ABCDFGIJ
KMQRSUVW
XZ

Mixed sequence :
TAKXEBMZLCQPDRHFSOGUNIVYJ W

(b) Numerical key, columnar transposition:

7-1-5-6-2-5-4-8
TELPHONY
ABCDFGIJ
KMQRSUVW
XZ

Mixed sequence :
EBMZHFSLCQN IVO GUPDRTAKXYJ W

Figure 11.

b. The last two systematically mixed cipher alphabets are transposi-
tion-mixed alphabets. Almost any of the methods of transposition
described in sections IV and V of this chapter may be applied to them.
