(2) The transcription process now follows. The cipher text is

written down, the letters being taken by following any pre-

arranged route, which must be perpendicular to the route of

inscription, otherwise the letters will follow in plain-text order.

In the following, the route is by columns from left to right.

(3) If the number of letters of the plain—text message exceeds the

number of cells disclosed by one placement of the grille, the
letters given by this placement are written down (in crypto-
graphic order), and then the grille is placed in the next position
on a fresh grid; the process is continued in this manner until
the entire message has been cryptographed. The several sections
of the cipher letters resulting from the placements of the grille
on successive grids merely follow each other in the ﬁnal crypto-
gram. In this manner of employment it is only necessary for
the correspondents to agree upon the initial position of the grille
and its successive positions or placements.
