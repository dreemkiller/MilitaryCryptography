of cryptograms prepared according to the same basic system. Often the
cryptanalyst is wholly unconcerned as to whether a literal or a numerical
key has been used in connection with cryptographing of the messages,
and he may frequently be unaware of the fact that a literal key has been
used as the basis for deriving a numerical key.

Section II. 'C'OLUMN'AR TRANSPOSITION METHODS

27. Columnar Transposition with Completely Filled Rectangles

a. One of the most common types of transposition involving the use
of a key word or a derived numerical key is that known as keyed or
variable-key columnar transposition. In this type the letters are usually
written in a geometric design, most often a rectangle, by inscribing them
in the ordinary manner, that is, in horizontal lines from left to right and
from the top downwards, and then the letters are transcribed by
“reading” the columns in the sequence determined by the numerical key.
If the text does not contain a sufﬁcient number of letters to ﬁll the last
line completely, as many nulls as are necessary to do so are added at the
end. Figure 5 is an example of cryptographing by this method.
