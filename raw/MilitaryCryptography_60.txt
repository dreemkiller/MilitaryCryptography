Section VI. CIPHER DISKS AND SQUARE TABLES
61. Cipher Disks

a. In the foregoing section it was noted that the separate alphabets
employed in the encipherment are produced by the use of only two strips
of paper bearing the normal alphabet. Such strips are often referred to
as sliding alphabets, because they can be shifted or slid against each other
in any one of 26 points of contact or coincidence. Exactly the same
results, so far as cipher equivalents are concerned, can be obtained by the
use of other devices. First, there are the so-called cipher wheels or cipher
disks in which an alphabet is written on the periphery of a rotating disk,
the circumference of which is divided into 26 equal segments, and this
disk is made to revolve concentrically upon a similar but slightly larger
ﬁxed disk. Figure 18 shows the now obsolete U. S. Army Cipher Disk,
which is of this simple type. Here the alphabetic sequences are printed
on glossy celluloid, are permanent, and admit of no variatiom The
use of unglazed celluloid upon which blank segments appear would
permit of writing letters and erasing them as often as desirable. Thus,
quick and easy change of alphabets would be possible.

 

To encipher a message, the key letter or the ﬁrst letter of the
key word or phrase is set opposite “a.” Let us assume it
to be "E." The cipher letters to be written are those
opposite the text letter when “a" on the circle is set
opposite "E” on the card. For example, “send powder"
would be written "MARBPQIBAN." To use a key word
or phrase, each letter is used in turn to encipher one letter
only. When the last letter of the key word is used, repeat
until all letters of the message are enciphered. Numbers
when enciphered with the disk must be spelled out.
