REF ID:A56932

The letters of the cipher text are taken from the diagram according
to any prearranged route, the most simple being to transcribe the lines
of letters in groups of ﬁves, thus:

EASEO MCTID MARCO TRMNO IECDO ITBEN
NOSRP SESNO MOANU TNTMN OFOPD FMEAT
TESWY OSLST NROBB LHOIW TECMN AEFAR
LNIRC BROME SCFLU HGOOP TDODO OBAEW

b. The foregoing method when employed in its most simple form
does not yield cryptograms of even a moderate degree of security;
but if the method of inscription and transcription is varied and made
more. complex, the degree of security may be increased quite notice-
ably. It is possible to use longer permutations, based on sets of 6,
7, 8, or 9 digits, but in every case the successive permutations must
be prearranged as regards both their exact composition and their order
or arrangement in the diagram. '

91. Transposition Method Using Special Figures

0. The method now to be described is useful only in special cases
where the correspondence is restricted to brief communications between
a very limited number of persons. It is necessary to agree in advance on
certain particulars, as will be seen. Let the message to be enciphered
be the following:

FOUR TRANSPORTS WILL BE COMPLETED BY END
OF APRIL AND SIX MORE BY END OF JULY.

Note the following ﬁgures and enciphcrment:
