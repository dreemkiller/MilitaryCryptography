have to be of a high order, and where the original form of the groups
must be retained even after encipherment. Transposition systems in
which the order of the letters within groups is changed may also be
employed. For example, a numerical key may indicate the transposed
order of the letters of the code groups, so that a group such as XDFGY
will become DFYXG.

c. Substitution systems of many sorts may be employed, ranging from
simple monoalphabetic to the most complex types of substitution with
cipher machinery. Tables of alphabets are often used. In some systems,
a simple transposition process may be combined with a simple substitu—
tion process.

d. A favorite method in one—part codes having both letter-code and
ﬁgure-code groups is that in which the letter-code group standing at a
prearranged interval before or after the letter—code group representing
the actual word or phrase intended to be conveyed is substituted. The
interval may remain ﬁxed within a single message, or it may vary accord—
ing to some predetermined key. Numerical code groups make the use of
large intervals practicable.

e. In modern practice, the most common methods of enciphering
ﬁgure-code groups are those using addition or subtraction, with a key
book containing arbitrary groups of ﬁgures. When such methods are
properly used, they yield a high degree of security. The highest degree
of security is attained when such a key book is used only once.
