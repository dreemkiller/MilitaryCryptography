and MA, = MAP. When both 01,, and 02,, happen to be in the same
column, there is no encipherment“, a fact which constitutes an important
disadvantage of this method. This disadvantage is only slightly less
obvious in the preceding cases where the cipher equivalent of such a case
of 5?”; consists merely of the plain~text letters in reversed order,
yielding We.

117. One-Alphabet Matrices; Playfair Cipher

(1. Limiting the matrix to one alphabet and modifying the method of
ﬁnding equivalents gives the basis for a well—known system called the
Playfair Cipher, which was not invented by Lord Lyon Playfair but by
Sir Charles Wheatstone. It was used for many years as a ﬁeld cipher
in the British Army. For a short time, 1917—18, it was prescribed as a
ﬁeld cipher for use in the United States Army. The modiﬁcatiOn in the
method of ﬁnding cipher equivalents has been found useful in imparting
a greater degree of security than that aﬂ‘ord‘ed‘ in the preceding types of‘

matrix methods. Figure 63 shGWS a typical Playfair square; The usual‘
method of encipherment can be best explained by examples given under-.-

ends of' the diagonal of' an imaginary- rectangl'e deﬁned by the-
two letters; the members of the cipher- -text pair, 91 and' 623, are-
at the opposite ends o_f_ the (_)_ther diagonal of this __imag__inary-

_r__ectangle. _Examples: M0,, = ALc; MID — —UC,; LUp = QMc;
