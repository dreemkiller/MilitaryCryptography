Section III. TYPES OF MIXED CIPHER ALPHABETS
45. Systematically Mixed Cipher Alphabets

It will be recalled that in a mixed cipher alphabet the sequence of
letters or characters in the cipher component does not correspond to the
normal sequence. 'There are various methods of mixing up the letters of
the cipher component, and those which are based upon a scheme that is
systematic in its nature are very useful because they make possible the
derivation of one or more mixed sequences from any easily remembered
word or phrase, and thus do not necessitate the carrying of written
memoranda. They are called systematically mixed cipher alphabets.

4b. Key-word Mixed Alphabets

a. One of the simplest types of systematically mixed cipher alphabets
is the key-word mixed alphabet. The cipher alphabet consists of a key
word or phrase (with repeated letters, if present, omitted after their ﬁrst
occurrence), followed by the letters of the alphabet in their normal
sequence (with letters already occurring in the key, of course, omitted).
Example, with GOVERNMENT the key word:

Plain: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRTSUVWXYZ
Cipher : GOVERNMTABCDFHIJKLPQSUWXYZ

1). Mixed alphabets formed by including all repeated letters of the key
word or key phrase were common in Edgar Allan Poe’s day but are
impractical because they make decipherment diﬂicult.

Plain: ABCDEFGHI J KLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Cipher: NOWISTHETIMEFORALIIGOODM'ENT
S Cipher: ABCDEFGHI J KLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

The average cipher clerk would have considerable difﬁculty in decrypto-
graphing a cipher group such as TOOET, each letter of which has three
or more equivalents, and from which the plain-text words (N) INTH,
. .FT THI (S), IT THI . . . , etc., can be formed on deciphcrment.

c. An example of a key-word mixed alphabet is shown in ﬁgure 9,
where, in its enciphering form, the cipher component presmts to the
experienced eye the skeleton of the key upon which the alphabet is
based: WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH COMPANY. Any easily
remembered word, phrase, or sentence may be used. The starting point
of the sequence, when used as a cipher component, may be indicated
in the usual manner. For example, in the alphabet referred to, the
