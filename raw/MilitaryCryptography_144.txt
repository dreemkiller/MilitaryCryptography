Since the row permutations of sections 2 and 4 are independent, the
total number of different four—alphabet matrices as regards row permu-
tations is 252 = 625. Taking into account the column permutations,
5 X 4 X 3 X 2 X 1 in number, it is therefore possible to have 625 X 120
or 75,000 different, four—alphabet matrices of this nature, based upon
the same two alphabets in sections 1 and 3. With changes in the latter,
the number, of course, becomes very much greater.

116. Two-Alphabet Matrices

a. lt is possible to effect digraphic substitution with a matrix con—
sisting of but two sections by a modiﬁcation in the method of ﬁnding
equivalents. In the checkerboard shown in ﬁgure 60, 01,, of 0—155, is
located in the square at the left, 0%, in the square at the right.

When W], are at the opposite ends of the diagonal of the imaginary
rectangle deﬁned by the letters, We are at the opposite ends of the
other diagonal of the same rectangle, just as in the preceding ease. F or
example, XI; = We; I'D—6p = EKG; Xi, = ﬁe; FED = ﬁfe.

b. Reciprocity may be imparted to the two—alphabet matrix by reciprocal
permutation of the rows of the squares, no attempt being made to effect
any reciprocal permutation of columns. Figure 61 shows such a matrix.
ﬁt, for example, A—W—p ="6Tc and m = We; EX}, =ﬁc and
DLp = me, etc.

c. In two—alphabet matrices in which one section is directly above the
other, reciprocity already exists without special preparations for its
