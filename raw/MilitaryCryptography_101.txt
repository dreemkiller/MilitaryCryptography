f. To decryptograph such a message, the cryptogram is written down
in a series of cross-section cells, which are then blocked off in sets
according to the numerical key:

5 2 6 3 1 5

IAIHIEISIOIXITIAIXITISINITINIDIXIAIBIPIXICIXIKIElolPTﬂ

Taking the letters in consecutive order out of the successive sets, and
crossing them off the series at the same time as they are being written
down to construct the plain text, the message is found to begin with
the following two words:

5. 2 6 3 1 5
IAIHIEISIOIXITIAIXITISINITINIDIXIAIBIPIXICIXIKTEIOIPIEI
ATTACK HAS . . .

g. Preparatory to cryptographing, it is necessary to ﬁnd the length
of the message to be enciphered and then to mark off as many cells as
will be required for encipherment. Nulls are used to ﬁll in cells that
are not occupied after cnciphering the whole message. The secrecy of
the method depends, of course, upon the reciprocal selected, but there
is no reason why any fraction that will yield a long series of digits
cannot be employed. If the selection of key numbers were restricted
to reciprocals, the secrecy would be more limited in scope than is actually
necessitated by the method itself.

 

 

90. Permutation Method

0. An old method, known in literature as the aerial telegraphy method,1
forms the basis of this system. A set of permutations of 3 4, . . .
9 digits is agreed upon and these permutations are listed in a deﬁnite
series. As an example, let these permutations be made of the digits 1
to 5, selecting only four of the possible 120. Suppose those selected
are the following, set down in successive lines of the diagram in
ﬁgure 33a:

1 So named because it was ﬁrst devised and employed in messages transmitted by a system of

semaphore signaling in practical usage in Europe before the electrical telegraph was invented.
