of course, is not an inherent necessity of the system; the decomposition
and recomposition alphabets may be entirely different. This is shown
in the example in paragraph 137d.

137. Comparison of Foreg-oing Fractionating System with
Certain Digraphic Systems

a. The method described in paragraph 136a can be identiﬁed with
some of the digraphic substitution systems discussed in chapter 9,
section I.

b. Take the message of paragraph 136e and let a slight modiﬁcation
in the method of recombining 01., and 0% be made. Speciﬁcallyﬂ let
the ﬁrst halves and the second halves of the biﬁd equivalents of the
plain-text letters be combined in the following manner, using the biﬁd
alphabet of paragraph 136e:

Message: ONE PLANE REPORTED LOST

ON EP LA NE RE PO RT ED
41=L 54=H 41=L 15=N 23=R 44=Q 22:1‘ 33=E
25=R 33=E 12=A 55=E 55=E 52=D 32=D 32=D

LO ST
44=Q 42:0
12=A 52=W

Cryptograml: LRHEL ANERE QDTDE DQAOW

If the cryptogram given in paragraph 1362 were split in the middle into
two sections, and the letters taken alternately, the result would be
identical with that obtained in this subparagraph. The identiﬁcation
referred to in a above is demonstrated in c below.

1:. Note the .two alphabet matrix shown in ﬁgure 68. If the same
message is now enciphered by its means, a cryptogram identical with
that obtained in b above will be obtained. Thus:
