being interchangeable) are inserted in any prearranged order. When
four such matrix alphabets are arranged in a large square as shown in
ﬁgure 58, the latter may be employed for digraphic substitution to yield
the same cipher results as does the much larger table I. In this square,
01,, of 370;, is sought in section 1; 0%, in section 2. Thus, 01,; and
02,, will always form the northwest-southeast comers of an imaginary
rectangle delimited by these two letters as located in these two
sections of the square. Then 91c and 02., are, respectively, the letters
at the northeast-southwest corners of this same rectangle. Thus,
T5, = T—K'c; W,, = ﬁe; 0—12,, = 13—55572; = We, etc. In
decryptographing, 01c and 9% are sought in sections 3 and 4, respectively,
and their equivalents, 0‘9 and 03, noted in sections 1 and 2, respectively.
It may, of course, be prearranged that 01,, should be sought in the section
now labeled 3, 02, in that labeled 4, whereupon ﬁle would be located
in the section now labeled 1, 02,, in that now labeled 2.

b. It is possible to construct a digraphic substitution matrix that shows
reciprocity in its '07,, = We relationship so that if 7173,, = We, for ex-
ample, then }Wp = ZR. Two conditions are essential to assure reci-
pﬂcity. These are taken into consideration in the establishment of the
0103,, or deciphering sections, and an example will serve to explain the
process.

c. Two enciphering alphabets are ﬁrst constructed; one in section 1
for 91,, the other in section 2 for 0%, as shown in ﬁgure 59a. The alpha-
bet in section 3 is now to be constructed. Any horizontal row of section
1 is taken, for example, the row labeled 1, consisting of the letters
BWGRM, and these letters are written on any horizontal row of section
