by individual, repeated countings, two strips of paper bearing normal
alphabets may be juxtaposed in the proper relative positions to encipher
a whole column of letters at one setting of the strips. Thus, for the ﬁrst
column, with the key number 7, the strips are juxtaposed so that the ﬁrst
letter in the column, viz., R (which is to be represented by the seventh
letter to the right of it, and is therefore to be enciphered by Y of the
lower strip) is directly above Y, as follows:

Plain :
AB CDEFGHI JKIMNOPQRS TUVWXYZABCDEFGHI J KLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Cipher: - ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

The equivalents for the rest of the letters of the ﬁrst column may now
be rewritten down in their proper places, reference being made to the
alphabet strips to see what the cipher letters should be: E, = Le;

I, = Pg; D, = K... For the second column the two alphabet strips are
in these relative positions:

Plain :
ABCDEFGHI J'KIMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Cipher: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

The cipher equivalents for the second column are: E, = Ia; M, = Qc;
N, = R". The process is continued in this manner until all the columns
have been enciphered, as shown in ﬁgure 17b.

The cipher text is then transcribed in groups of ﬁve- letters, reading
the successive lines in the normal manner, that is, from left to right and
from the top downwards, yielding the groups YIEQF, QYGLQ, etc. It is
