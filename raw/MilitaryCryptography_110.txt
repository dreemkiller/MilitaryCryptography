REF ID:A56932

The ﬁrst, Or D—l, rectangle is inscribed in the usual manner of simple
numerical key columnar transposition. It is shown as D—l in the accom-
panying ﬁgure. . The letters of T—l transposition are then inscribed
in the second, or D—Z, rectangle in the normal manner of writing, that
is, frorn left to right and from the top downwards. This is shown in
D—Z of ﬁgure 42a for the ﬁrst two columns of D—l (in numerical key
order.) after transfer of their letters into D—Z. The letters of the
remaining columns of D—1 are transferred in the same manner into
D—Z, yielding the following rectangle:

4—7—12-3—11 — 8—- 1—13— 5- 10 — 9—2—6

For the T—Z text- the letters are transcribed from the D—2 rectangle,
reading down the'columns in key-number order, and grouping the letters
in ﬁves. The Cryptogram is as follows:

e. In paragraph 29 a variation of the simple columnar key method
of transposition was described. If the process therein indicated is
repeated, double transposition is effected. The following example will
serve to illustrate the method, using the same message and key as were
used in the paragraph 29:

Message: REQUEST IMMEDIATE REENFORCEMENTS
Keyword: P R 0 D U C T
Derived numerical key: 4-5-3-2-7-1-6
