example, suppose that it is agreed that every keyletter will encipher a

number of letters corresponding to the numerical value of the keyletter
in the normal alphabet. The foregoing example then becomes as follows:

Key: D E B A R

Plain text: COLL ECTAL LS T RAGGLERSSTOPSENDTH
Cipher: BPSS ACLET QJ H ARLLGNAZZYDCZNEOYK
Key: K D

Plain text: EMFORWARDAT ONCE

Cipher: GYFWTOKTHKR PQBZ

Cryptogram: BPSSA CLETQ JHARL LGNAZ ZYDCZ NEOYK
GYFWT OKTHK RPQBZ

d. The foregoing example employed reversed standard alphabets, but
mixed alphabets of all types may readily be used.

e. If the keyword is short, and the message long, periodicity may creep
in despite the irregular groupings in the encipherment. Sufﬁcient evidence
may even be obtained to lead to a disclosure of the length of the key. But
if the key consists of a long word, or of a complete phrase or sentence,
the text would have to be very long in order that sufﬁcient evidences of
periodicity be found to make possible the determinaton of the length of
the key.

126. Suppressing Periodicity by Enciphermen’r by Variable-Length
Greupings of the Key

0. In paragraph 125b periodicity was suppressed by enciphering
variable—length groupings of the text; in this paragraph it will be shown
how periodicity may be suppressed by enciphering by variable—length
groupings of the key. The method consists in interrupting the key.

b. Given a keyword, it can become a variable-length key by inter—
rupting it according to some prearranged plan, so that it becomes
equivalent to a series of keys of different lengths. Thus, the single key-
word UNPREPAREDNESS may be expanded to a sequence of irregu-
lar lengths, such as UN PREP/UNP/UN PREPAR/UN PR/UN PRE-
PARE/UNPREPAREDN/U/UNPRE, etc. Various schemes for indi-
cating or determining the interruptions may be adopted. For example,
suppose it may be agreed that the interruption will take place immedi-
ately after and every time that the letter R occurs 'in the plain text. The
key would then be interrupted as shown in the following example:

Key: UNPUN UNPRE PARED UNPRE UNPRU NP . . .
Plain text: OURFR ONTLI NESAR ENOWR EPORT ED . . .

c. It is possible to apply an interrupted key to variable-length group-
ings of the plain text. In illustrating this method, an indicator, the letter
