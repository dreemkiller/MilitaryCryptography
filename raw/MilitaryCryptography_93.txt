85. Transp05ition Systems Employing Geometric Designs

in part one brief mention was made of the use of geometric designs
and ﬁgures other than rectangles in producing transposition ciphers. It
was stated that triangles, trapezoids, and polygons of various symmetrical
shapes can be employed. Figures of these types form connecting links
between the methods that use simple rectangular designs and the more
complicated methods that use ﬁgures in which transposition takes place
along diagonals.

86. Trapezoidal Designs

(1-. A trapezoid or, more accurately, a truncated triangle, of pre—
arranged dimensions as regards the number of cells (which in this case
are rhombs into which it is to be partitioned, is constructed. There will
be left on one side of the design a series of small triangles which are not
to be used for inscribing letters, and are therefore crossed off in the
design, as shown in ﬁgure 24. Only two agreements are necessary in
order .to fix the dimensions of the design: a keyword or keyphrase to
determine the number of cells at the base of the design, and an under-
standing as to the height of the design expressed in number of cells. The
successive horizontal rows of cells will decrease by one in number from
bottom to top of the design. In ﬁgure 24, the keyphrase NO CANDY
FOR ISSUE is used as a basis for deriving a numerical key of 15 ele—
ments, and it is assumed that by prearrangement it was agreed that the
height of the design should be eight cells. Therefore, the bottom row
has 15 cells, the next one upwards, 14, the next, 13, and so on, to the
last, with 8 cells. The inscription may follow any route agreed upon; in
the example, it follows the normal manner of writing. The transcription
follows the numerical key order, yielding this cryptogram:
