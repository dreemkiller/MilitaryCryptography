d. Polyﬁd cipher alphabets may be systematically-mixed alphabets
based upon keywords and keyphrases. For example, note how the

following biﬁd alphabet is derived from the keyphrase XYLO-
PHONIC BEDLAM:

XYLOP IC
11121314152 2 23242 3 3 3

MFGKQRSTUVWZ
34 35 41 42 43 44 45 51 52 53 54 55

HN BEDA

The same principle may be applied to triﬁd alphabets, employing the
permutations of the three digits 1, 2, and 3, taken in groups of three.
e. Note the following bifid alphabet and the example of its use in
enciphering a message:
ABCDEFGHI—JKLM
12 31 21 32 33 15 25 34 24 35 41 11

NOPQRSTUVWXYZ
13 42 43 44 23 45 22 14 51 52 53 54 55

Message: ONE PLANE REPORTED LOST

The biﬁd elements, 0%, and 9%, are now recombined horizontally in
pairs and the pairs are reconverted into letter equivalents of the basic
alphabet which, for the sake of convenience, is here arranged in the
form of a deciphering alphabet:

f. It will be noted that there are four basic steps involved in the
foregoing cncipherment: (1) A process of decomposition, substitutive
in character, in which each 0,, is replaced by a bipartite 0,, composed of
two parts, 01,, and 02,, according to a biﬁd alphabet; (2) a process of
separation, transpositive in character, in which each 01,, isseparated
from the 0% with which it was originally associated; (3) a process of !
recombination, also transpositive in character, in which each 01,, is *
combined with a 0% with which it was not originally associated; and
ﬁnally (4) a process of recomposition, substitutive in character, in
which each new 01., 03c combination is given a letter value according to
a biﬁd alphabet. In the foregoing example (e above), the alphabet for
the recomposition was the same as that for the decomposition; this,
