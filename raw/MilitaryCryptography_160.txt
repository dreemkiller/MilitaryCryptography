134. Monoalphabeﬁc and Polyalphabetic Substitution Combined
with Transposition

a. A message may undergo simple monoalphabetic substitution or
complex polyalphabetic substitution and the resulting text passed through
a simple transposition. Obviously, either standard or mixed alphabets
may be employed for the substitution phase and for the transposition
phase any one of the simple varieties of geometric-design methods may
be applied.

b. As an example, note the following simple combination, using the
message ALL ACTION AT LANDING BEACH HAS CEASED.
lst step: sC1 (monoalphabetic, by mixed alphabet) :

I’lain : ABCDEFGHI J KLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Cipher: TDRAMOBNILPEZYXWVUSQKJHGFC

Message: ALLAC TIONA TLAND INGBE ACHHA SCEAS ED
Cipher: TEETR QIXYT QETYA IYBDM TRNNT SRMTS MA

2d step: tC2 (as prearranged between correspondents):

TEETRQIX (F01- the inscription; a rectangle of eight columns.)

YTQETYAI
YBDMTRNN (For the transcription; counterclockwise route beginning

TSRMTSMA at lower right hand corner.)
Cryptogram: ANIXI QRTEE TYY’l‘S RMTSM NAYTE QTBDM TR

6. A simple subterfuge often adopted between correspondents is to
write the substitution text backwards to form the ﬁnal cryptogram
(a case of simple reversed writing).

d. An extremely simple and yet effective transposition method
(when its presence is not suspected) sometimes employed as a pre-
liminary to substitution is that in which the text of a message is
ﬁrst divided-into halves; the second being placed under the ﬁrst as
in rail-fence writing. Thus:

POEDOOTFMAKTO
RCETPROEBRAIN

Then encipherment by simple monoalphabetic methods may be effected
and the cipher text taken from the two Separate lines. Thus, if a
standard alphabet one letter in advance were used, the text would be
as follows:

QPFEPPUGNBLUP
SDFUQSPFCSBJO

Cryptogram: QPFEP PUGNB LUPSD FUQSP FCSBJ 0
