the top line of the table in addition to the 26 letters. For example, one
could have the 10 digits; a few common double-letter combinations, such
as DD, LL, RR, SS; a few of the most frequently used pairs of letters,
such as TH, ER, IN, or even such common syllables as ENT, INC, and
ION

63. Square Tables Employing Mixed Alphabets

a. In the tables thus far shown the alphabets have been direct or
reversed standard sequences, but just as mixed sequences may be written
upon sliding strips and revolving disks, so can mixed alphabets appear in
tabular form. The table shown in ﬁgure 22, based upon the key word
sequence derived from the word LEAVENWORTH, is an example that
is equivalent to the use of a strip bearing the same key word sequence
sliding against another strip bearing the normal alphabet.

The usual method of using such a table is the same as that in the pre-
ceding cases. The only difference is that the key letters must now be
s°ught in a mixed sequence, whereas in the preceding tables they were
located in normal direct or reversed sequences. Example, using ﬁgure 22:

Cr (Sh) = Xe.
