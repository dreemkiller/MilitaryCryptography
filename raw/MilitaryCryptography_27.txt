b. It is apparent that instead of following the normal direction of
writing, that is, from left to right and from the top downwards, the
letters of the plain text may be inscribed according to any one of the
routes agreed upon, and then transcribed to form the cipher text by
taking the letters from the rectangle in the normal manner, that is,. in
this case from left to right, and from the top downwards, or by follow-
ing any other route of transposition.

22. Example of Encipherment and Decipherment by Monolil-eral
Route Transposition

(1. Now take a special example of encipherment by monoliteral route
transposition. Use the message ATTACK HAS BEEN POSTPONED
UNTIL TOMORROW TWO AM, and employ a relatively cemplicated
method. Suppose that the general system agreed upon is the one being
described, and that the speciﬁc key consists of the following elements:

(1) Using a completely ﬁlled rectangle of seven columns;

(2) Inscribing the letters of the plain text within the rectangle by
following route (F) (3) of ﬁgure 1;

(3) Transcribing the thus inscribed letters (to form the cipher text)
by following route (E) (6) of ﬁgure 1.

Since the message contains a total of 40 letters, and it has been
agreed to use a completely ﬁlled rectangle of seven columns, it is
necessary to add two nulls to make the total numberof letters a
multiple of seven. A rectangle of seven columns of cells and six
lines of cells is therefore prepared. The design is then ﬁlled in as
shown in ﬁgure 2.

b. To decryptograph such a cryptogram the process is merely reversed.
First, the total number of letters in the cipher text must be found. Since
