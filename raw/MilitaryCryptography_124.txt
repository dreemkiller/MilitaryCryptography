c. Another way in which the grille may be used is to change the
position of the grille after the 16th letter has been inserted, then after
the 32d, 48th, and 64th ; the 65th letter is then inserted to the righﬂ of
the lst, the Slst, to the right of the 17th, and so on until the grid is com-
pleted.

d. Whole words may, of course, be inserted in the cells disclosed by
the apertures, instead of individual letters, but the security of the latter
method is much lower than that of the former.

e. The text of the grid may be transcribed (to form the cryptogram)
by following any prearranged route.

1‘. The successive positions of a post card grille may be prearranged.
The order 1, 2, 3, 4 is but one of 24 different sequences in which it may
be superimposed upon the grid.

g. A modiﬁcation of the principles set forth in paragraph 103, dealing
with the construction of revolving grilles, is applied in the construction
of rectangular or “post card” grilles. Note the manner in which the
cells in a of ﬁgure 51 are assigned numbers; homologous cells in each
band receive the same number. In a of ﬁgure 52 there are three bands,
