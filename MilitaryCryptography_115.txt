c. It is obvious that by the use of a simple grille the. letters of a
message to be CTYPtngaPhed may be distributed within an enveloping
message consisting mostly of “dummy” text, inserted for purposes of
enabling the message to escape suppression in censorship. 'For example,
suppose the grille shown in ﬁgure 43 is employed in position 1 and the
message to be conveyed is ALL DESTROYERS OUTSIDE. The
letters of this message are inscribed in their proper places on the grid,
exactly as shown in ﬁgure 44. An “open” or disguising text is now to
be composed; the latter serving as an envelope or “cover” for the letters
of the secret text, which remain in the positions in which they fall on
the grid. The open or disguising text, in other words, is built around or
superimposed on the secret text. Note how this is done in ﬁgure 45, with
an apparently innocent message reading:

I HAVE WORKED VERY WELL ALL DAY, TRYING TO- GET
EVERYTHING STRAIGHTENED UP BEFORE GOING ON MY
NEXT TRIP SOUTH, BUT INSIDE TEN DAYS . . .

d. The foregoing method naturally requires the transmission of con—
siderably more text than is actually necessary for conveying the message
intended. Where questions of censorship are not involved, the method
is therefore impractical. A modiﬁcation of the method suggests itself in
the use of a transparent sheet of paper superimposed upon a square or
other ﬁgure in which the individual cells are irregularly numbered and
the inscription process follows the sequence of numbers. An example is
shown in ﬁgure 46, using the message ROCK CREEK BRIDGE WILL
BE DESTROYED WHEN TAIL HAS CROSSED.
