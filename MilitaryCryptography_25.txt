within a rectangle in the usu-al manner of writing, that is, from left to
right and in consecutive lines from top to bottom. If one or more cells
are vacant at the end, nulls or dummy letters—letters having no signiﬁ-
cance—are inserted as “ﬁllers” to complete the rectangle. Then, to form
the cipher text, the letters in the design are taken out of the design and
rewritten or transcribed by following or tracing one of many different
routes. It is possible for each route to have a diﬂ’erent starting point, and
normally it is one of the four corners of the rectangle. A few typical
routes are illustrated in ﬁgure 1 where, for the sake of ease in following
the route, the plain—text message is assumed to be merely the sequence
of letters A B C X.
