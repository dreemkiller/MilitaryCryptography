b. Decryptographing is merely the reverse of cryptographing, there
being no difﬁculties provided that the design has been correctly con-
structed. For this purpose cross—section paper will be found useful. The
analysis of such a cryptogram is somewhat complicated by the presence
of columns having varying numbers of letters; it may be further com-
plicated by following complex routes in inscription. It is also possible

to follow a numerical key in the inscription of the plain text in horizontal
lines; this additional procedure would further complicate and delay
solution.

87. Triangular Designs

a. The simplest way of drawing up a triangle for cryptographing is to
take cross—section paper, draw a square the side of which is equal to the
length agreed upon as expressed in the number of cells, and then draw
a diagonal cutting the large square into two equal triangles. This is
shown in ﬁgure 25, where the length agreed upon is nine, that is, nine
cells per side. The letters of the plain text are inscribed in accord-
ance with any prearranged route, the one illustrated in ﬁgure 26 be-
ing a simple method wherein the letters are inscribed in horizontal
lines in the normal manner. When so inscribed, the letters in the dia-
gram will form 2n — 1 columns where n is the number of cells
forming one of the sides of the square from which the triange has been
constructed. The total number of letters that can be inscribed within
