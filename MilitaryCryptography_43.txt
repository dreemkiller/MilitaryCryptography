deciphering alphabet. An enciphering alphabet and its corresponding
alphabet present a verse and inverse relationship to each other. To invert
a deciphering alphabet is to write the corresponding enciphering alphabet;
to invert an enciphering alphabet is to write the corresponding decipher—
ing alphabet.

SYSTEMS

41. Single-Alphabet Substitution

If a message is enciphered, letter—for—letter, by using one cipher
alphabet which has been drawn up for the purpose, the resulting crypto-
gram is said to be enciphered by a single alphabet and to-be a single-
alphabet, or monoalphabetic, substitution cipher. More complex ciphers
may use several alphabets in the enciphering of a single message. When
two or more cipher alphabets are used, the resulting cryptogram is said
to be a polyalphabetic cipher.

42. Standard Alphabet Ciphers

a. Standard cipher alphabets are of two sorts:
(.1) Direct standard, in which cipher component is the normal
sequence but shifted to the right or left of its point of coinci—
dence in the normal alphabet. Example: I

—>
Plain: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Cipher : QRSTUVWXYZAB CDEFGHI JKLMNOP

-—’,
It is obvious that the cipher component can be applied to the
plain component at any one of 26 points of coincidence, but
since the alphabet that results from one of these applications
coincides exactly with the normal alphabet, a series of only
25 (direct standard) cipher alphabets results from the shifting
of the cipher component.
