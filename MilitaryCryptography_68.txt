Such apparatus can obviously be practicably employed only among the
larger headquarters where trafﬁc is suﬂiciently heavy to warrant its use.

67. Disadvantages and Limitations of Cipher Systems

Except for certain electrically operated cipher machines equipped with
a typewriter keyboard, most cryptographic methods using “manual"
or “pencil and paper” cipher systems are unsatisfactory for military pur—
poses. Practically all such systems can be solved by enemy cryptanalysts,
and those suitable for use in the theater of operations offer fewer ob—
stacles to solution than systems suitable for use in the rear areas. Cipher
systems are not economical in time units required in electrical transmis-
sion; the best that they can do is to produce cryptograms no longer than
the original plain text. For use within small tactical units in the forward
areas there are other cryptographic methods which offer advantages of
speed, simplicity, and brevity and which, properly used, afford suﬂ’icient
cryptographic security. These are often preferred over cipher methods in
the forward echelons of the combat zone. These methods involve the use
of lists of groups of letters or ﬁgures to which arbitrary meanings have
been assigned. They are called “ﬁeld codes,” “prearranged-message
codes,” “brevity codes,” “voice codes,” “jargon codes,” etc. Codes will
be discussed in the succeeding sections of this manual.
