The transcription may now follow any prearranged route. The normal
method of reading would produce the cryptogram beginning WCTEH
OEERI, etc. It is obvious that the correspondents must possess designs
with identically numbered cells.8

99. Revolving Grilles

a. In this type of grille (see ﬁg. 47a) the apertures are also formed
by perforating a sheet of cross-section paper according to prearrange-
ment, but these apertures are so distributed that when the grille is
turned four times successively through angles of 90° and set in four
grille positions on the grid, all the cells on the grid are disclosed in turn.
(The preparation of such grilles is discussed in par. 103.) If letters are
inserted in the cells so disclosed, then after a complete revolution of the
grille every one of the cells of the grid will contain a letter and thus the
grid will be completely ﬁlled. For this reason such a grille is also called
a self—ﬁlling, or an automatic-completion grille. The secrecy of messages
enciphered by its means is dependent upon the distribution or position of
the apertures, the sequence of grille positions on the grid, that is, whether
in the order 1, 2, 3, 4 clockwise; or 1, 3, 4, 2 etc.), and the route followed
in inscribing and transcribing the letters in the cells of the grid. For each
position of the grille, one-fourth the total number of letters of the text
is inscribed; hence it is convenient to refer to “sections” of the text, it
being understood that each section consists of one-fourth the total num-
ber of letters.

b. There are two possible procedures so far as the inscription-trans-
scription sequence is concerned. (1) The letters of the plain text may be
inscribed in the cells of the grid through the apertures disclosed by the
grille and then, when the grid has been completely ﬁlled, the grille
removed, and the letters transcribed from the grid according to a pre-
arranged route; or, (2) the letters of the plain text may ﬁrst be inscribed
in the cells of the grid according to a prearranged route and then the
grille applied to the completely-ﬁlled grid to give the sequence of letters

'The system employed by the French Army in 1886 was of the nature here described.
