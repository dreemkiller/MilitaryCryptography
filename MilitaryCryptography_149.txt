binations for digraphs in a unique manner. To encipher a message One-
proceeds as usual to ﬁnd the numerical equivalents of a pair, and then
these numbers are added together. Thus:

Plain text: PR OC EE DI NG
275 350 100 075 325
9 13 24 18 7

Cipher text: 284 363 124 093 332

b. To decipher such a cryptogram, take the greatest multiple of
25 contained in the group of three digits; this multiple and its remainder
form the elements for determining the plain-text pair in the usual
manner. Thus, 284 = 275 + 9 = PR.

Section III. COMPLEX SUBSTITUTION SYSTEMS
120. General

In paragraph 64, brief reference was made to more complex substitu-
tion systems. It was stated that there are certain polyalphabetic methods
in which periodicity is absent; there are other methods in which the
external manifestation of periodicity in cryptograms is prevented, or
in which it is suppressed or disguised. Slight hints were then given as
to the nature of some of these methods. This and the next two sections
give a more detailed description and discussion of the methods indicated,
which, as a class, may be designated as aperiodic systems, as contrasted
with the previously described, more simple periodic systems.
